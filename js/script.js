function processEmail() {

  // stop form submit unless Firefox
  event.preventDefault();

  // traverse the DOM to access the form field 
  var email = document.getElementById('email');

  // print to the console a friendly message, including the value of the "email" form field
  console.log("Thanks for signing up for our mailing list, " + email.value + "!")

// As an extra challenge, you can build the product listings
// by looping over this array and creating HTML for each element.
// This will be best accomplished after we do lesson 09.
